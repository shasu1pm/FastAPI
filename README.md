# FastAPI
FastAPI Simple Food Order is a lightweight, clean backend API built with FastAPI for demonstrating. A simple FastAPI project I built to learn backend API development, showing cuisine-based food retrieval and item lookup using async endpoints. A clean learning path for mastering FastAPI and REST APIs in Python.
